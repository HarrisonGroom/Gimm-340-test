            <p>Welcome to GIMM Garage! This application was designed to aid the students of Boise State University find
                parking for both automobiles and bikes/skateboards, as well as give parking prices based on the lot and
                notify the user of any upcoming campus events that might make parking limited or unavailable.</p>

                parking. Whether due to being a new student or a student with disabilities, we aim to create a user
                experience that makes student life easier and more efficient. </p>
